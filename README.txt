ABOUT THE GAME

The game is a scaled down UCFK reimagination of the 1983 arcade game “Bomberman”. Players move around the map using the navswitch and can drop bombs which appear on the other player’s screen.



THE SCREEN

The map is drawn using the LED matrix. LEDs that are turned on represent walls, and LEDs that are turned off represent paths.

Bombs also show up as turned on LEDs, and similar to walls cannot be walked through.

Your player is the flashing LED. The other player is invisible, but their bombs will appear on your screen as soon as they are dropped.




CONTROLS

When the funkit loads the game, a player should press the navswitch button down to start the game and to let the other player’s board know that a player has started the game. Only one player needs to press the navswitch button to start the game for both players.

Move the player using the navswitch.

Drop a bomb by pushing the navswitch button down.



BOMBS

Each player can place up to 3 bombs simultaneously. Trying to place more than 3 bombs at once will remove the first bomb placed and place a new one with its timer reset. Each bomb has a 3 second time delay before it explodes.

When a bomb explodes it sprays deadly shrapnel up to 2 LEDs from its explosion point. Shrapnel will not go through walls or travel on diagonals.



AIM OF THE GAME

Kill the other player with your bombs before they kill you with theirs. Try not to blow yourself up either.



RESTARTING THE GAME

If one or both players have reached the game over state, the game can be restarted by providing any input to the navswitch.
